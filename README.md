# Now with variable font demo!

Get and/or configure 

Check out 'html/varfonts.html' and 'css/varfonts.css' to see how it all comes together. This is using Gingham and Amstelvar, two open-source projects that provide a good starting point.

## Resources

### Browsers

Safari: https://webkit.org/downloads/ 
Unfortunately, while this was the first way to try them, newer versions don't support variable fonts. However, support will be on by default in Safari onHigh Sierra, which will be released mid-September, 2017.

Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html
All you need to do is enable 'experimental web features' in the normal shipping browser (Mac or Windows). Full support will likely be on by default when Chrome 62 ships in mid-October, 2017. Set flags by typing 'chrome://flags' in your address bar, and search for 'Experimental web platform featurs', and click the link to enable them.

iOS: Looks like iOS 11 will have variable font support enabled by default in Safari!

You can find tips for enabling support in other browsers by checking out this post from Laurence Penney on his essential variable fonts playground, Axis Praxis: http://www.axis-praxis.org/blog
